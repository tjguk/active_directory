12th Jan 2008 0.7
. Added general-purpose find_... function to _AD_object instances.

  .search (objectClass="abcDef", name="xxx") and returns the first
  item found.
. Added ability to clear cache
. Some tidying-up and commenting
. Added hashability to allow for inclusion in sets
. Added general-purpose .search_... function which operates in
  the same way as find_...

                   Allowed find_user / find_computer to have default values,
                    meaning the logged-on user and current machine.
                   Added license: PSF

20th Oct 2004 0.3  Added "Page Size" param to query to allow result
                    sets of > 1000.

                    switched to SQL queries.

19th Oct 2004 0.2  Added support for attribute assignment
                     (see AD_object.__setattr__)
                   Added module-level functions:
                     root - returns a default AD instance
                     search - calls root's search
                     find_user - returns first match for a user/fullname
                     find_computer - returns first match for a computer
                   Now runs under 2.2 (removed reference to basestring)
